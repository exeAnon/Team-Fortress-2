#Custom ToonHUD

This is my customized & edited version of ToonHUD, I hope you enjoy it!<br>
The original HUD was created by [Griever](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038927965) and is available for download [here](http://toonhud.com/).

##What's New?
**Stylish assets!**<br>
ToonHUD carried almost, but not exactly, the simplistic design that's popular nowadays.<br>
It now features stylish icons from [Metro Studio](http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio).<br>

On top of that, I thought the default backgrounds were always a little drab and lifeless.<br>
I put together some of [bin8ry](http://bin8ry.deviantart.com/gallery/)'s artwork to replace the default menu & loading screens.
